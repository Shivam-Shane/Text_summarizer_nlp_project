# Brief explanation of the application
## Information ðŸ“±
This web application utilizes [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/task_summary.html#summarization) ðŸ¤— to leverage a pre-trained summarisation pipeline to start **summarising** content. This web application excels in summarizing news articles. 

## Features ðŸ’»
* Summarize your text up to 500 words!
* Input the desired text that needed to summarize.
* See the summary of text afterwards!

## Hugging Face Transformers ðŸ¤—
Hugging Face Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, etc in 100+ languages. Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.

# AWS-CICD-Deployment-with-Github-Actions

## 1. Login to AWS console.

## 2. Create IAM user for deployment

	#with specific access

	1. EC2 access : It is virtual machine

	2. ECR: Elastic Container registry to save your docker image in aws


	#Description: About the deployment

	1. Build docker image of the source code

	2. Push your docker image to ECR

	3. Launch Your EC2 

	4. Pull Your image from ECR in EC2

	5. Lauch your docker image in EC2

	#Policy:

	1. AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

	2. AmazonEC2FullAccess

	
## 3. Create ECR repo to store/save docker image
    - Save the URI: a url like thing.

	
## 4. Create EC2 machine (Ubuntu) 

## 5. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:
	
	
	#optinal

	sudo apt-get update -y

	sudo apt-get upgrade
	
	#required

	curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

	sudo sh get-docker.sh

	sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

	newgrp docker
	
# 6. Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:
    setting>actions>runner>new self hosted runner> choose os> then run command one by one


# 7. Setup github secrets:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= # you will found in Aws while creating user account for sepecif user account

    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= # you will found in Aws while creating user account for sepecif user account

    AWS_REGION = us-east-1 # there region i which your cloud hosted server

    AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI = demo>>  566373416292.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

    ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME = text_summarizera/or the name you define.
